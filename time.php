                  The Silver Jubilee happened to be in the year 1957. The revolutionary year since the beginning was 1957 as the victories of VSV flew high and set a standard for the rest of the world. On the very same day the AKHIL BHARATIYA GANDHARVA MAHAVIDHYALAYA MANDAL Recognized  VSV and we got our Examination Centre for Classical Music.
