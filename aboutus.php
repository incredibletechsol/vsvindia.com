							<b>SHRI VISHNU SANGEET VIDHYALAYA </b>was found in the year 1932 on January 1st. Even today on every New Year, a huge event is organized where students and teachers together sing and express the happiness that is infinitely impossible to explain in words, says one of our students. The Institute is situated in Nashik - The city of pilgrimage - also called city of grapes, in the Hundiwala Lane (Old Nashik City)  mainly known as the settlement of Late Shri Keshaveao Maind. Institute carried out the teachings for the first four years in the same place and then the institution got its first and permanent place at the Hatthikhana Road which is today well known as Mahatma Gandhi Road ( M.G Road). Taking a glance at the founder of this Institute, Late Pandit B.R. Trivedi and Late Smt.Kusumavati Trivedi - A man of glory and a woman of exceptional willpower. The main objective behind the establishment of this institution was to make society aware of Music and make Music one of the important art form (Preaching Music). The Name of the Institute was commenced as 'VISHNU SANGEET SCHOOL' and later named as 'VISHNU SANGEET VIDHYALAYA'. This was named by the founder in the memory of their beloved Guru Gayanacharya Late Pandit Vishnu Digambar Palluskar after his death in the year 1931. After the death of Late Pandit B.R.Trivedi, Late Prafullata Khaty took over the administration. She was the head of VSV for 30 years. She herself was postgraduate of M. A. MUSIC and taught Hindustani Classical Music and Light Music for over 50 years.
