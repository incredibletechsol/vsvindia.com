It has been entered in the Guinness Book of World Records for the largest number of people singing Vande Mataram, India's national song. Conceived by Sri Sri, the aim of Antarnaad was to showcase the vast repertoire of Hindustani classical music as well as to provide a platform for the exponents of this ancient Indian art. Stating that classical music and spirituality are among the most definitive and unique offerings India can make to the world, Sri Sri said, "Spirituality and music together can uplift people, get them out of depression and help them start a new life with enthusiasm. For a stress-free life, you have to embrace both these facets (spirituality and music)."<br>
                                         Musicians from across the country, celebrity singers like Shankar Mahadevan and renowned names like Pt Rajan &Sajan Misra were also part of this event. The singers enthralled a live audience of over 2 lakh people. The practice for the complete program for all the students in Nashik was done in VSV.
